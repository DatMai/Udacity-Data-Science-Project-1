## Write a Data Science Blog post - How data will make you cinema savvy

### Installations

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

### Project Motivation
I’m a movie buff; I’ve always been immersed in movies. I love them so much that I want my life to be like one of those movies one day. And today, I’m going to do an analysis of the top movies in the world to help people answer these questions:

`What are the best movies?`

`What is the most common language in cinema?`

`What is the correlation between the score and the popularity of the movie?`

I want to analyze movies to be able to convey this to the film-loving community in a better way, and from there, we can learn more about movies.
